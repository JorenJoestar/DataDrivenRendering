# Data Driven Rendering
Testing data driven rendering code using ImGUI and SDL with Flatbuffers to generate data and UI.
This is a Visual Studio 2017 + Windows 10 only tested code.
The interesting part of the code is self contained and should be easily portable.

## Build
In order to build, do the following:

1. Download SDL 2.0.9, Glew 2.1.0, Flatbuffers 1.11.0
2. Unzip them in a common folder
3. Add the environment variable LIB_PATH pointing to that folder
4. Copy the x64 dll of SDL and GLEW into the Bin folder.
5. Compile and run!

Any comment, feedback, error please let me know!
